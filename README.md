# cima-events

A website for easy and centralized event planning/management.

## Overview
CIMA Events is a website dedicated to helping users organize and plan events for 
their peers. This project aims to create a simple but enjoyable user interface 
made using Material UI (MUI) to allow users to login and see the events of groups 
they're subscribed to. 

This is the main repository for the CIMA Events project.

The project is developed following the [MERN full-stack design architecture](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) with TypeScript.

## Running
This project requires you to have Node.js installed as the main dependencies are installed using the built-in Node Package Manager (npm).

Clone the repository. 

There are two folders for dependencies: server and client. Use `npm install` in each of them to install all the dependencies listed in their respective package.json.
