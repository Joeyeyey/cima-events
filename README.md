# cima-events

A website for easy and centralized event planning/management.

## Overview
CIMA Events is a website dedicated to helping users organize and plan events for 
their peers. This project aims to create a simple but enjoyable user interface

they're subscribed to. 

This is the main repository for the CIMA Events project.

The project is developed following the [MERN full-stack design architecture](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) with the 
addition of [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for the front-end.

## Running
